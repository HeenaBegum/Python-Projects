Utilized Python to explore and analyze data from SleepInc's sleep-tracking app to identify lifestyle, health, and demographic factors that correlate most strongly with poor sleep quality. Based on my analysis, I drew conclusions about the factors most associated with poor sleep quality and provided recommendations for individuals seeking to improve their sleep.
